MidTermProject_VendingMachine.cpp

Write a program that simulates a soft drink machine.

The Machine-Menu should display the following when starting out.



Drink Name                                 Cost                        Number in Machine

1)     Cola                                     .75                          20

2)     Root Beer                            .75                          20

3)     Lemon-Lime                        .75                          20

4)     Grape                                  .75                          20

5)     Cream Soda                       .75                           20

6)     Quit

Each time the program runs, it should enter a loop that performs the following steps:



A list of drinks is displayed on the screen.  The user should be allowed to either quit the program or pick a drink.

If the user selects a drink, NOTE: (If the user selects a drink that has sold out, a message should be displayed. And the user should be allowed to pick again).

subtract one from the number of that drink left in the machine

Prompt him or her to enter the amount of money that is to be inserted into the drink machine.  The function should give the amount of change

 The loop then repeats.  When the user chooses to quit the program it should display the total amount of money the machine earned.  And the remaining inventory.

Input Validation: When the user enters a selection, do not accept any value below 1 and above 5.

input Validation: When the user enters an amount of money, do not accept negative values, or values greater than $10.00.
