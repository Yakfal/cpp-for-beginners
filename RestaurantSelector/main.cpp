Write a program that asks whether any member of your party are
"vegetarian", "vegan", or "gluten-free",
then display only the restaurants that you may take the group to.

Make the program run until the user is finished using it.

Here is an example of the program's output:

****************************************************

*    Is anyone in your party a vegetarian?   (yes)

*    Is anyone in your party a vegan?  (no)

*    Is anyone in your party gluten-free?  (yes)

*    Here are your restaurant choices:

*                   Main Street Pizza Company

*                    Corner Cafe

*                    The chef's kitchen

**********************************************

Here is a second example of a possible program output:

****************************************************

*    Is anyone in your party a vegetarian?   (yes)

*    Is anyone in your party a vegan?  (yes)

*    Is anyone in your party gluten-free?  (yes)

*    Here are your restaurant choices:

*                    Corner Cafe

*                    The chef's kitchen
